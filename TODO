Bitboard
Threat map
    - The more squares a player attacks the better the static eval
    - Dont move pieces to where a pawn can attack them
Draw by repetition
Pawn structure static eval
Bishop pair static eval
Internal iterative deepening for move sorting if no move from the tt was found
Look into futility pruning / Late Move Reduction / Killer moves

Fix the pv being broken once a new best move has been found:
